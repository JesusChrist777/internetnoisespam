      <p>On March 29, 2017, <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/115-2017/h202" target="_blank">congress voted to allow</a> ISPs the legal right to track, utilize, and sell your personal data. This means that your search history, your location info, or anything you buy or read online is accessible to anyone willing to pay. This includes (but is not limited to) advertisers, government agencies, landlords or loan officers.</p>
      <p>Internet Noise was created as a way to flood an ISP's database with misinformation, in an attempt to render your personal browsing data too distorted to monitize.</p>
